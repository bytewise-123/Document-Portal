Digital Document Portal - A High-Fidelity Prototype
This project is a high-fidelity, interactive web prototype of a Digital Document Portal for educational institutions. It was developed using the Design Thinking methodology to address the inefficiencies and frustrations of traditional paper-based document request systems.

The portal provides a streamlined, intuitive, and efficient platform for both students and administrative staff to manage the entire lifecycle of official document requests online, from initial submission and verification to final delivery.

‚ú® Key Features
Role-Based Dashboards: Separate, tailored interfaces for Students and Staff.

Real-Time Status Tracking: Students can see the live status of their requests (e.g., Submitted, Action Required, Processing, Ready).

Two Request Types:

Document Request: For official documents like Bonafide Certificates, Transcripts, etc.

Verification Submission: For submitting external documents (e.g., offer letters) for attestation.

Interactive Request Hub: A modal window for viewing conversation history, exchanging files, and taking actions.

Dynamic UI: The interface is built with vanilla JavaScript and updates instantly based on user actions.

Responsive Design: Fully responsive layout built with TailwindCSS, ensuring a great experience on all devices.

Client-Side Prototype: The entire application runs in the browser without needing a backend, making it easy to demonstrate and test the user experience.

üöÄ Live Demo / Screenshots
(You can add a link to your live demo here if you deploy it on GitHub Pages or another service.)

The application workflow is demonstrated through the following key screens:

Login Screen: Users select their role to enter the portal.

Student Dashboard: Students can view all their requests and their current statuses.

New Request Form: Students can easily initiate a new request through a simple form.

Staff Dashboard: Staff have a centralized view to manage all incoming student requests.

Request Review Modal: Staff can review details, see uploaded files, and take action on a request.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
This prototype was built using only front-end technologies:

HTML5: For the structure and content of the application.

TailwindCSS: For a modern, utility-first approach to styling.

JavaScript (ES6+): For all the application logic, state management, and interactivity.

Lucide Icons: For clean and lightweight SVG icons.

‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started
Since this is a client-side prototype contained in a single HTML file, there is no complex setup required.

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/document-portal.git](https://github.com/your-username/document-portal.git)

Navigate to the directory:

cd document-portal

Open the HTML file:
Simply open the index.html file (or the main HTML file of the project) in your favorite web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

That's it! The application will be running locally in your browser.

üìã Project Workflow
The application simulates a real-world document approval process:

A Student logs in and creates a new request, uploading any required documents. The request status is set to Submitted.

A Staff member logs in and sees the new request on their dashboard.

The staff member reviews the request. They can either:

Change the status to Processing.

Add a comment and change the status to Action Required if more information is needed.

The Student sees the status update and, if necessary, uploads additional files, changing the status to Resubmitted.

Once everything is correct, the Staff member approves the request, uploads the final document, and changes the status to Ready.

The Student can then download the final document.

üîÆ Future Scope
This prototype serves as a strong foundation. For a full-scale production system, future enhancements would include:

Backend & Database: Integrate a robust backend (e.g., Node.js, Django) and a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to persist data.

User Authentication: Implement a secure login system, potentially linked to the institution's SSO.

Email Notifications: Add automated email alerts for status changes.

ERP Integration: Connect the portal to the college's main ERP system for seamless data synchronization.

Mobile App: Develop a native mobile application for an even better user experience on the go.
